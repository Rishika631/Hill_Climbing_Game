 * Project Description:
 * This project is a 2D side-scrolling racing game designed to deliver an engaging experience by combining challenges 
 * such as collecting coins and managing fuel, all while maintaining speed and balance. 
 * The game features immersive animations, smooth controls, and dynamic environments that evolve as players progress 
 * through checkpoints. It's built on HTML5 Canvas for graphics rendering, with JavaScript handling the game logic 
 * and user interactions. 

 * Game Objective:
 * The objective is to navigate through a rugged terrain by controlling a vehicle. Players must maintain speed, 
 * collect coins to increase their score, and manage their fuel level to avoid running out before reaching 
 * checkpoints. If the player loses balance or runs out of fuel, the game ends.

 * How to Play:
 * 1. Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to accelerate, decelerate, and control the rotation of the car.
 * 2. Collect coins scattered throughout the terrain to increase your score.
 * 3. Pick up fuel canisters to replenish your fuel level.
 * 4. Keep an eye on the progress bar and reach checkpoints to unlock new themes and earn bonus rewards.
 * 5. Avoid tipping the car over or running out of fuel, as either will result in a game over.
